* APL/BQN Keyboard
  This is an [[https://aplwiki.com/][APL]] / [[https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/][BQN]] [[http://omz-software.com/pythonista/docs/ios/pythonista_shortcuts.html#pythonista-keyboard][Keyboard]] written for use with [[http://omz-software.com/pythonista/][Pythonista 3]]. It can then be used system-wide on IOS devices.

** Updates in this Fork
  - Since iOS devices vary in size, there is now a (fairly dumb) script to scale the keyboard layouts as needed.
  - Added examples of scaled keyboards that work on my devices (feel free to suggest others)

** Setup
   - First you'll need to have the Pythonista Keyboard enabled on your device per the [[http://omz-software.com/pythonista/docs/ios/pythonista_shortcuts.html#pythonista-keyboard][documentation]].
   - Next you'll need to install the files from this repository in Pythonista.  (I have them under "This Phone".)
   - Then you'll have to let the Python Keyboard know to use this module.
     - Find the top level Pythonista menu
     - Click on the Settings icon in the lower right
     - Open Pythonista Keyboard
     - Click on the + at the top to add this module
     - Supply the name of the module (i.e. APLKeyboard) and a title and pick an icon and/or color
   - I needed to restart my iPhone to pick up the addition of the new keyboard the first time
   - You should be good to go!

** Modifications
   The script is sitting in your version of Pythonista so feel free to make whatever modifications
   seem appropriate.  I tried to pull out the colors to the script to make it easier to modify.

   Still, feel free to open issues and/or post pull requests.  I'll merge them if they seem
   generally useful.
